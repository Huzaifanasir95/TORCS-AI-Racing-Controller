# TORCS AI Racing Controller

This repository contains the implementation of an AI-based car racing controller for the **TORCS (The Open Racing Car Simulator)** framework, developed in Python as part of the **AI 2002** course project. The project aims to design a controller that races competitively on various tracks, using telemetry data from sensors to navigate, avoid obstacles, and optimize speed.

## Project Overview

The objective is to create a Python-based controller for a car racing bot in TORCS that competes on unknown tracks, either alone or against other bots. The controller uses telemetry data from sensors (e.g., track limits, car state, lap time) to make real-time driving decisions. Key requirements include:
- **No rule-based controllers**: The controller must use AI techniques (e.g., machine learning, reinforcement learning, or neural networks).
- **Performance Metrics**: Optimize speed, track following, and obstacle avoidance.
- **Simplified Environment**: Noisy sensors, car damage, and fuel consumption are disabled for simplicity.

The project has two deliverables:
1. **Deliverable 1**: Implementation of telemetry.
2. **Deliverable 2**: Final controller implementation, submitted as a self-contained archive with all execution files.

This repository includes the code for both deliverables.
